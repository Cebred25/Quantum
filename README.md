# FMO Complex Exciton Transport Simulator
This repository contains code to simulate exciton transport in the
7-site Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex using the Lindblad master
equation with Markovian dephasing, based on Adolphs & Renger (2006).

The code generates all visualizations used in the preprint, including:

- Scatterplots of efficiency vs coherence monotones
- Heatmaps for 2-parameter sweeps (γ vs k_sink)
- Time-evolution population curves
- Surface plots of efficiency landscapes
